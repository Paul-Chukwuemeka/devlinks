Here are the steps to set up Google Sign-in for your project:

1.  **Go to the Google API Console:**
    Navigate to [https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/).

2.  **Create or Select a Project:**
    Create a new project or select an existing one from the project dropdown.

3.  **Go to Credentials:**
    In the left-hand navigation menu, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".

4.  **Create OAuth Client ID:**
    Click on "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" at the top of the page and select "OAuth client ID".

5.  **Configure OAuth Client ID:**
    *   For the "Application type", select "Web application".
    *   Give it a name (e.g., "Devlinks App").

6.  **Add Authorized URIs:**
    *   Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", click "+ ADD URI" and enter `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   Under "Authorized redirect URIs", click "+ ADD URI" and enter `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`.

7.  **Create and Copy Credentials:**
    *   Click the "CREATE" button.
    *   A modal will appear showing "Your Client ID" and "Your Client Secret". Copy both of these values.

8.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    *   In the root of your project, create a file named `.env` if it doesn't already exist.
    *   Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with the credentials you copied in the previous step:

    ```
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    ```

9.  **Set Database URL:**
    Your `auth.ts` file also requires a database connection string. Add your PostgreSQL database URL to your `.env` file:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
    ```
    Replace `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, `PORT`, and `DATABASE` with your actual database connection details.

10. **Restart Your Server:**
    Stop your Next.js development server if it's running and restart it with:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

After following these steps, you should be able to sign in with Google on your application.
